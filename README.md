# It's raining somewhere.

This is a poetic experience that allows you imagine a different world beyond your living place. When you press the umbrella button below, you will see the city that is raining now and the popular song in that country. 
It is a window to the world you don't know.
As for implementation, I used OpenWeatherMap API, GeoDB Cities API, Last.fm API, and Youtube Data API.
